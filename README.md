# About the Dataset
This dataset has been designed for machine learning practice and contains information about users and their purchasing behavior.

# Initial Structure:
Rows: 500
Columns: 3

Age – Age of the individual
Estimated Salary – Approximate annual salary of the individual
Purchased – Target variable (binary: 0 = Not Purchased, 1 = Purchased)

# Feature Engineering:
Additional columns were created through feature engineering to enhance predictive performance.

# ETL Process:
Data preprocessing and transformation steps were performed, including handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

# Machine Learning Models:
Multiple models were trained to predict the Purchased outcome. The results were evaluated using accuracy and other performance metrics.This dataset provides a compact yet practical resource for classification problems, covering the end-to-end machine learning workflow from ETL → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation.
